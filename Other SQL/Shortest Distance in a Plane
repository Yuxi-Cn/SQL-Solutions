612. Shortest Distance in a Plane

- Solution 1.
with cte as (
    select x, y, row_number() over(order by x, y) as rn
    from point2d
)
select round(min(dist),2) as shortest from(
    select p1.x, p1.y, sqrt(pow(p2.x-p1.x, 2)+pow(p2.y-p1.y, 2)) as dist
    from cte p1
    join cte p2 on p2.rn>p1.rn) a

- Solution 2.
select round(sqrt(min(pow(a.x-b.x, 2)+pow(a.y-b.y, 2))), 2) shortest
from point2d a, point2d b
where (a.x, a.y) <> (b.x, b.y)
