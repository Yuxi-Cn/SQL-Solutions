2308. Arrange Table by Gender

- Solution 1.

with f_gender as (
    select user_id, gender, row_number() over(partition by gender order by user_id) as rn
    from Genders
    where gender = 'female'
),
m_gender as (
    select user_id, gender, row_number() over(partition by gender order by user_id) as rn
    from Genders
    where gender = 'other'
),
o_gender as (
    select user_id, gender, row_number() over(partition by gender order by user_id) as rn
    from Genders
    where gender = 'male'
),
comb_gender as (
    select user_id, gender, rn from f_gender
    union all
    select user_id, gender, rn from o_gender 
    union all
    select user_id, gender, rn from m_gender 
)

select user_id, gender
from comb_gender
order by rn, field(gender, 'female','other','male')


- Solution 2.

with sortgender as (
    select 
          user_id, 
          gender, 
          row_number() over(partition by gender order by user_id) as rn
    from Genders
)
select 
      user_id, 
      gender
from sortgender
order by rn, field(gender, 'female','other','male')


- Solution 3.

select user_id, gender
from Genders
order by dense_rank() over(partition by gender order by user_id), 
length(gender) desc


- Solution 4.

select user_id, gender
from Genders
order by rank() over(partition by gender order by user_id), 
if(gender='female', 0, if(gender='other', 1, 2))
