- Solution 1.

select 
max(case when continent = 'America' then name end) as 'America',
max(case when continent = 'Asia' then name end) as 'Asia',
max(case when continent = 'Europe' then name end) as 'Europe'
from (
    select *, 
    row_number() over(partition by continent order by name) as rn
    from student) a
group by rn

- Solution 2. (MS SQL Server / T-SQL)

select  America, Asia, Europe
from (select *, 
             row_number() over(partition by continent order by name) as rn 
      from student
      ) as student_2
pivot
(max(name) 
for continent in 
([America], [Asia], [Europe])
) as pivot_table


- Solution of the Follow-up question

with cte as (select 
max(case when continent = 'America' then name end) as 'America',
max(case when continent = 'Asia' then name end) as 'Asia',
max(case when continent = 'Europe' then name end) as 'Europe'
from (
    select *, 
    row_number() over(partition by continent order by name) as rn
    from student) a
group by rn)

select distinct count(America) over() as America_num,
       count(Asia) over() as Asia_num,
       count(Europe) over() as Europe_num
from cte
