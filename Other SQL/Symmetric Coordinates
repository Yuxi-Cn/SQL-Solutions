2978. Symmetric Coordinates


- Solution 1.

with rn_order as (
    select 
          *, 
          row_number() over(order by X) as rn
    from Coordinates
)
select 
      distinct a.X, a.Y 
from rn_order a
join rn_order b
  on a.X = b.Y and a.Y = b.X and a.rn != b.rn
where a.X <= a.Y
order by a.X, a.Y


- Solution 2.

    select
          distinct a.x, 
          a.y
    from Coordinates a, Coordinates b
    where a.x < b.x 
    and a.x = b.y 
    and a.y = b.x 
union all
    select 
          distinct a.x, 
          a.y
    from Coordinates a
    where a.x = a.y
    group by x
    having count(*) > 1

order by x, y
