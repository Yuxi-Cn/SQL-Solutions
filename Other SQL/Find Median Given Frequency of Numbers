571. Find Median Given Frequency of Numbers

- Solution 1.
with recursive cte1 as(
    select num, frequency, 1 as sequence from numbers
    union all
    select num, frequency, sequence + 1 from cte1 
    where sequence < frequency
)
select round(avg(num), 1) as median 
from (
    select num, 
           frequency, 
           row_number() over(order by num) as rn,
           count(*) over() as total_num
    from cte1
) as sub1
where rn between total_num/2 and total_num/2+1

- Solution 2.
select avg(num) median
from (
    select *, 
            sum(frequency) over(order by num) freq, 
            (sum(frequency) over())/2 median_num
    from numbers) as sub1
where median_num between freq - frequency and freq
