with bus_arrival as (
    select

    from Buses
)

select 
      b.bus_id, 
      count(p.passenger_id) as passengers_cnt
from bus_arrival b
left join Passengers p 
       on p.arrival_time <= b.arrival_time 
       and p.arrival_time > b.pre_arrival
group by b.bus_id

- Solution 2.

select 
      b.bus_id, 
      ifnull(count(passenger_id),0) as passengers_cnt
from Buses b

    from Buses b
    join Passengers p
        on p.arrival_time <= b.arrival_time
    group by passenger_id
) temp1 
on b.arrival_time = temp1.bus_arrival
group by bus_id
