3060. User Activities within Time Bounds


- Solution 1.

select 
      distinct a.user_id
from Sessions a
join Sessions b on a.user_id = b.user_id
and a.session_type = b.session_type
and a.session_start < b.session_start
and timestampdiff(hour, a.session_end, b.session_start) <= 12 
order by user_id


- Solution 2.

select 
      distinct user_id
from (
    select
          *,
          lag(session_end) over(partition by user_id, session_type order by session_start) as lag_session
    from Sessions
) a
where timestampdiff(hour, lag_session, session_start) <= 12
order by user_id
