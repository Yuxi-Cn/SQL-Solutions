2893. Calculate Orders Within Each Interval

- Solution 1.

with recursive cte as (
    select
          *,
        ceil(minute/6) as interval_no 
    from orders
)
select 
      interval_no,
      sum(order_count) as total_orders
from cte
group by interval_no
order by interval_no


- Solution 2.

select 
      if(minute % 6 = 0, minute/6, ceil(minute/6)) as interval_no,
      sum(order_count) as total_orders
from orders
group by 1
order by 1


- Solution 3.

select 
      ceil(minute/6) as interval_no,
      sum(order_count) as total_orders
from orders
group by ceil(minute/6)
order by ceil(minute/6)
