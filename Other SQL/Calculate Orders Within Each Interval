2893. Calculate Orders Within Each Interval

- Solution 1.

with recursive max_interval as (
    select 
          ceil(max(minute) / 6) as max_int 
    from orders
),
order_interval as (
    select 1 as interval_no
    union all
    select interval_no + 1 as inteval_no
    from order_interval
    where interval_no < (select max_int from max_interval)
)
select 
      oi.interval_no, 
      sum(o.order_count) as total_orders
from order_interval oi
left join orders o on ceil(o.minute/6) = oi.interval_no
group by oi.interval_no
order by oi.interval_no


- Solution 2.

with recursive cte as (
    select
          *,
        ceil(minute/6) as interval_no 
    from orders
)
select 
      interval_no,
      sum(order_count) as total_orders
from cte
group by interval_no
order by interval_no


- Solution 3.

select 
      if(minute % 6 = 0, minute/6, ceil(minute/6)) as interval_no,
      sum(order_count) as total_orders
from orders
group by 1
order by 1


- Solution 4.

select 
      ceil(minute/6) as interval_no,
      sum(order_count) as total_orders
from orders
group by ceil(minute/6)
order by ceil(minute/6)
