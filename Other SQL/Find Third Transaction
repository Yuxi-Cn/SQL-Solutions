- Solution 1.

with cte as (
    select 
          user_id, 
          spend, 
          transaction_date, 
          row_number() over(partition by user_id order by transaction_date) as rn
    from Transactions
    order by user_id, transaction_date
    )

      c.spend as third_transaction_spend, 
      c.transaction_date as third_transaction_date
from cte c
join cte a 
    on c.user_id = a.user_id 
    and c.rn - 1 = a.rn
join cte b 
    on c.user_id = b.user_id 
    and a.rn - 1 = b.rn
where c.rn = 3 
     and c.spend > a.spend 
     and c.spend > b.spend
order by a.user_id 


- Solution 2.

          lag(spend,2) over(partition by user_id order by transaction_date) as first_spend
    from Transactions
)
