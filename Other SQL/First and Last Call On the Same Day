1972. First and Last Call On the Same Day

- Solution 1.

with all_calls as (
    select caller_id, recipient_id, call_time from calls
    union all
    select recipient_id as caller_id, caller_id as recipient_id, call_time from calls
),
rn_calls as (
    select 
          caller_id, 
          recipient_id, 
          call_time,
          row_number() over(partition by caller_id, date(call_time) order by call_time) as first_call,
          row_number() over(partition by caller_id, date(call_time) order by call_time desc) as last_call
    from all_calls
)

select 
      distinct caller_id as user_id 
from rn_calls
where first_call = 1 or last_call = 1
group by caller_id, date(call_time)
having count(distinct recipient_id) = 1

- Solution 2. (for the final step)

select 
      distinct a.caller_id as user_id
from rn_calls a, rn_calls b
where a.caller_id = b.caller_id 
  and a.recipient_id = b.recipient_id 
  and a.first_call = 1 
  and b.last_call = 1
