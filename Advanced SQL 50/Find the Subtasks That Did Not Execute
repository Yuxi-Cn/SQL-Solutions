1767. Find the Subtasks That Did Not Execute

- Solution 1.
with recursive cte_task as (
    select 1 as n
    union all
    select n+1 
    from cte_task
    where n+1 <= (select max(subtasks_count) from tasks)
),
full_subtasks as (
    select t.task_id, c.n as subtask_id
    from tasks t
    cross join cte_task c
    where c.n <= t.subtasks_count
)
select fs.task_id, fs.subtask_id
from full_subtasks fs
left join executed e using(task_id, subtask_id)
where e.task_id is null or e.subtask_id is null
order by 1, 2

- Solution 2.
with recursive cte as (
    select task_id, subtasks_count, 1 sub from tasks
    union all
    select task_id, subtasks_count, sub + 1 from cte
    where sub < subtasks_count
)
select c.task_id, sub as subtask_id
from cte c left join executed e 
on c.task_id = e.task_id and c.sub = e.subtask_id
where e.subtask_id is null
