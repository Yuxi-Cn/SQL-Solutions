613. Shortest Distance in a Line

- Solution 1.
select min(diff) as shortest
from (
    select p1.x as x1, 
           p2.x as x2, 
           abs(p2.x - p1.x) as diff
    from point p1
    join point p2 on p1.x <> p2.x
    where p1.x < p2.x
) as sub

- Solution 2.
select min(a.x - b.x) as shortest 
from point a, point b
where a.x > b.x
