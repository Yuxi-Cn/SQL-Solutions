select min(log_id) as start_id, max(log_id) as end_id
from (
    select log_id, row_number() over(order by log_id) as rn
    from logs
) as sub1
group by log_id - rn


- Solution 2. (T-SQL)

with cte as (
    select 
        log_id,
        row_number() over(order by log_id) as rn,
        row_number() over(order by log_id) - log_id as diff
    from Logs
)
select 
      min(log_id) as start_id,
      max(log_id) as end_id
from cte
group by diff
order by start_id
