1661. Average Time of Process per Machine

- Solution 1.
select a.machine_id, 
round(
    avg(case when a.activity_type = 'end' then a.timestamp end) -
    avg(case when a.activity_type = 'start' then a.timestamp end)
    , 3) as processing_time
from Activity a
group by a.machine_id

- Solution 2. (PostgreSQL)
select a.machine_id, round(avg(process_time)::numeric, 3) as processing_time
from (
    select machine_id, sum(case 
when activity_type = 'start' then -timestamp else timestamp end) as process_time
from activity
group by machine_id, process_id
) a
group by 1
